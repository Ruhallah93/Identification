Data Set Information:

The dataset collects data from an Android smartphone positioned in the chest pocket. Accelerometer Data are collected from 22 participants walking in the wild over a predefined path. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.
--- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: DELAY_FASTEST with network connections disabled
--- Number of Participants: 22
--- Data Format: CSV

Attribute Information:

--- Data are separated by participant
--- Each file contains the following information
---- time-step, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration
